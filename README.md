From the graph, it shows that:
Rural cities has the least amount of drivers, rides and total fares.
Urban cities have the most amount of drivers, rides and total fares.
Suburban cities are in the middle having the 2nd most drivers, rides and total fares.
End of Feb in 2019 was the peak of the period.

Summary:
To make ride-sharing more accessible across city types, a ride-sharing infrastructure that could smoothly connect the three main areas would be required. It is also important that the service be affordable for all passengers travelling to or from any city. These services must be affordable as well as convenient in terms of commuting time, since high charges or long journey times are likely to deter passengers from utilising these services as their primary mode of transportation.
